# TTT_Weapon_Rarities
Weapons now come in 3 flavors. Common, Uncommon, and Rare. Each tier gets harder to find. Sounds cool in my head!

To make this work, each weapon must have a rarity set in their lua file. Sorry about that.
Eventually I want to add a way to dynamically set weapons rarity in the F1 menu but other projects got me excited!
To make it easier, you can copy the below line and put it in there:

-- weapon spawn rarity (common, uncommon, rare)
SWEP.Rarity					= "common"
